<h1>Introducing Cordova-JS</h1>

<p>If it's not obvious, I'm trying to get back to tech blogging, this time on my own personal site. A lot of exciting things happened in the past six months or so:
my former employer <a href="http://nitobi.com">Nitobi</a> got acquired by <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a> and our team of about 18 more or less got split up
right down the middle. Half are now settling into San Francisco, while the rest (me included) are manning the Canadian fort in Vancouver and doing our best to represent
<a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a> up in the Great White North.

- Road to 2.0: plugins encapsulating device apis
    - composed of javascript and native
    - api with objectives to be easily composable and as platform-agnostic as possible
- A big step towards this is modular javascript, shout out to people involved
- Uses simple, synchronous modular javascript definition
    - talk about require syntax 
- Base is a common API definition, however allows for platform overrides
- Status: landed in Android; BlackBerry and iOS lined up
- Lots to do: better api definition method, platform implementations, native tweaks to line it all up
