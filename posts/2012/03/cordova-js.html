<h1>Introducing Cordova-JS</h1>

- Road to 2.0: plugins encapsulating device apis
    - composed of javascript and native
    - api with objectives to be easily composable and as platform-agnostic as possible
- A big step towards this is modular javascript, shout out to people involved
- Uses simple, synchronous modular javascript definition
    - talk about require syntax 
- Base is a common API definition, however allows for platform overrides
- Status: landed in Android; BlackBerry and iOS lined up
- Lots to do: better api definition method, platform implementations, native tweaks to line it all up
